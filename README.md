AI-Powered Identity Verification & Fraud Detection for KYC Compliance

An end-to-end AI system for AADHAR document verification, address validation, and fraud detection for BFSI KYC/AML workflows using Computer Vision, NLP, Graph Analysis, and Azure Cloud.

📌 Problem Statement

Manual KYC verification is slow, error-prone, and expensive. Fraudsters frequently reuse addresses, manipulate identity documents, or submit inconsistent data across documents.

This project automates:

Identity verification from AADHAR and KYC documents

Address extraction and normalization

Detection of fraudulent address patterns

Real-time KYC decision support aligned with AML/KYC compliance
